# UBILABS TEST 1 - HTML

Create an HTML page that shows a simple login form with a button, an email and
a password field. As soon as the user hits "submit", the page should prevent
them from submitting the form with a simple message when something is wrong.

* Must work in latest Chrome.
* No styling needed.
* Keep it as simple as possible.

Sounds easy. And it is easy if done right.
Try to keep it under 1/2 hour.
